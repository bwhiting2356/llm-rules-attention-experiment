    "## LLM Performance Following Many Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the ability of various LLM models to handle an increasing number of rules or constraints to follow within the prompt. Through personal experience, I’ve observed that LLMs often forget instructions or fail to recall previous context. This experiment attempts to quantify the limit of rules an LLM can effectively manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment involves asking the LLM to generate text that adheres to a specific list of constraints found in `rule_options.csv`. Each rule is simple on its own (e.g., 'Mention a museum'). However, when asked to follow 20 rules, the LLM's performance begins to decline (see results below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the model with the largest context window, Gemini 1.5, does not perform the best. But in Google's promotion of this model emphasizes its performance in needle-in-a-haystack tests rather than its ability to reason about the entire context (the 'whole haystack') (refer to this [Google blog post](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This could also connect with thinking that others are doing with [LLM routers](https://github.com/pulzeai-oss/knn-router). If a prompt is particularly complex, it could be routed to a more advanced model or an 'agent' that uses a divide & conquer strategy, or does a QA step and more iteration before delivering the result."

Instead, I was stuck in Paris, scrolling through Twitter and feeling a familiar pang of loneliness.\n",

      "Lost in my thoughts, I wandered into the Musée d’Orsay. Inside, a photographer was meticulously setting up a Hasselblad camera to capture a Degas ballerina painted with delicate brushstrokes.

I needed a jolt, a catalyst for change.\n",

Her words, delivered with the passion of a Shakespearean soliloquy, resonated deeply.\n",

This time, I was determined to see it through.  I wouldn't let the project languish like a wilting rose.  I had a story to tell, and I wouldn't let fear – that insidious psychological barrier – hold me back any longer.\n",

Suddenly, the world seemed full of possibilities.  I fired off an email, the melody of the concert still ringing in my ears. Maybe, just maybe, this was the start of something new, a change in the winds. \n",

The cafe's television, tuned to the History Channel, showed a documentary about Queen Elizabeth I, her reign, and the inflation that plagued England during her later years. On the other side of the city, in a grand theater, actors rehearsed a scene from \"Sherlock,\" the popular BBC show. Sherlock, the titular character, stood on stage, his piercing gaze fixed on the audience, a silent testament to the power of deduction. \n",

      "response text The screenwriter, hunched over their Macbook in a sweltering August heatwave, felt a surge of frustration. Their screenplay, a period drama set during the American Civil War (19), about a heartbroken king (14) struggling with the concept of forgiveness (17), was due to the studio before Labor Day. They were stuck on a pivotal scene where the protagonist, standing in the desolate Sahara Desert (13), gazes up at the Milky Way (8) and contemplates his mortality.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writer, an avid reader of poetry, particularly enjoyed the works of Maya Angelou (21). They wanted to utilize a similar lyrical narrative technique (1) to convey the king's internal turmoil, but the words felt flat, like day-old champagne. To clear their head, they switched on the radio (4), landing on a classical music (15) station playing Beethoven's Symphony No. 5. \n",
      "\n",
      "A sudden idea struck. What if they incorporated a musical motif throughout the film (33), echoing the symphony's dramatic shifts to mirror the king's emotional journey? They imagined the scene in the desert shot with a wide-angle lens (34) on a vintage Arriflex camera (18), the vastness mirroring the character's isolation. The king's loneliness could be further emphasized by showing him playing a solitary game of solitaire (11).\n",
      "\n",
      "Reenergized, the writer typed furiously. They envisioned the scene culminating in the king, his eyes filled with tears (7), finally uttering the words, \"I forgive you.\" This catharsis would mark a turning point in the narrative, leading to a bittersweet resolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Taking a break, the writer glanced at an article in Time Magazine (36) about Leonardo DiCaprio (38), who they pictured playing the lead role. They could already imagine him delivering the line with heartbreaking sincerity. The image of DiCaprio, standing desolate against the backdrop of the desert, felt iconic, like a scene ripped from a classic film like \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (25).\n",

      "Suddenly, their phone buzzed. It was an email notification reminding them of their upcoming trip to London in October (40). They planned to visit the Globe Theater (20) to watch a Shakespearean play (9) and draw inspiration from the Bard himself. They also hoped to visit the National Gallery (24) to see Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" (31) again, its vibrant colors always a source of creative energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The writer smiled.  Maybe, just maybe, this trip would be the missing piece, the mathematical constant (12) that would help their story finally add up. They just needed to remember to pack their Canon camera (34) and a good book of poetry. They were particularly interested in checking out the winner of the latest National Book Award for Poetry (22).\n",
      "\n",
      "Their mind wandered back to the screenplay. They envisioned a final scene set in a bustling London park during the springtime (3).  Families picnicking, children chasing pigeons, cherry blossoms dotting the landscape - a stark contrast to the film's earlier, desolate scenes. This juxtaposition would highlight the king's internal transformation, his journey from despair to hope. \n",

He smiled, remembering the spring day he’d taken that photo, a welcome respite from the winter’s chill. That was it! His protagonist needed a source of unconditional love, a reason to keep fighting.

      "response text On a chilly Tuesday in November, I found myself reminiscing about my trip to Nepal last spring.  I had always dreamed of seeing Mount Everest, and while I didn't quite make it to base camp, the breathtaking panorama from our trek was more than enough.  I tried to capture the majesty of the Himalayas with my camera, experimenting with long exposure techniques to create ethereal, dreamlike images. Back home, I edited the photos on my trusty Dell laptop, hoping to recreate the vibrant colors of the prayer flags fluttering in the wind. \n",

      "My trip wasn't all about mountains, though.  I spent a week in Kathmandu, immersing myself in the vibrant culture.  The Holi festival was in full swing, and the city was awash in a kaleidoscope of colored powders. I visited the Patan Museum, home to incredible Buddhist and Hindu art, and wandered through the narrow alleys, discovering hidden art galleries showcasing Thangkas - colorful, intricately detailed paintings on cloth.  One gallery owner, a skilled artisan himself, told me fascinating stories about the symbolism within these works, referencing ancient Buddhist texts and the life of Buddha himself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Later that week, I found myself in a bustling internet cafe, trying to upload my photos to Instagram.  The internet was slow, a stark contrast to the lightning-fast fiber optic connection I was used to.  While waiting, I chatted with a local programmer who was working on a project using Python, a language I had dabbled in myself.  He told me about the challenges of developing software in a country still recovering from the devastating earthquake of 2015, a natural disaster that had left its mark on the landscape and the people. \n",

      "We talked about everything and nothing - the impact of globalization on the Nepali economy, the popularity of the game \"Carrom\" amongst the locals, the upcoming cricket match between Nepal and India (cricket being something akin to a religion in this part of the world). He introduced me to Nepali folk music, and the mournful strains of the sarangi, a traditional string instrument, filled the air.  Later that evening, I found myself at a local theater, watching a performance of a play by Shakespeare, translated into Nepali.  The lead actor, a man with piercing eyes and a commanding presence, reminded me of a young Marlon Brando.  The play, a tragedy set against the backdrop of the Hundred Years' War, resonated with the audience, many of whom had lived through their own share of hardship.\n",

The caption simply read, \"Wish you were here.\"  \n",

      "My friend, ever the romantic, even sent a haiku about the experience. Apparently, he'd been bitten by the poetry bug. In the background of the text, I could hear the faint strains of samba music, a far cry from the classical piano concerto I had been listening to earlier.

      "He had truly embraced the spirit of adventure, something I deeply admired.  A notification popped up on my phone: a reminder for my upcoming trip to London.  I had tickets to see \"Hamlet\" at the Globe Theatre, a pilgrimage for any theatre enthusiast.  My excitement grew. It was time to create my own adventures.

      "Closing my laptop, I decided to book a last-minute ballet class. Dance was my way of releasing pent-up energy and processing emotions, especially after watching Leonardo DiCaprio’s latest film about a tortured artist.

      "Scrolling through my Spotify playlist, I landed on my favorite song by a local indie band and hit play. As the music filled my small apartment, I couldn't help but feel a surge of gratitude.  Life was a tapestry of experiences, a vibrant mix of highs and lows, and I was determined to embrace every moment.  Tomorrow, I would start planning my next adventure. Perhaps a trip to see the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris? Or maybe a trek through Yosemite National Park to witness the raw power of nature firsthand?  \n",

Maybe one day, my own story would be shared on a platform like National Geographic, inspiring others to embrace their wanderlust and explore the beauty of our diverse and magnificent planet.
