    "## LLM Performance Under Many Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explores the ability of various LLM models to handle an increasing number of rules within given instructions. Through personal experience, I’ve observed that LLMs often forget instructions or fail to recall previous context. This experiment attempts to quantify the limit of rules an LLM can effectively manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment involves asking the LLM to generate text that adheres to a specific list of constraints found in `rule_options.csv`. Each rule is simple on its own (e.g., 'Mention a museum'). However, when asked to follow 20 rules, the LLM's performance begins to decline (see results below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, the model with the largest context window, Gemini 1.5, does not perform the best. Notably, Google's promotion of this model emphasizes its performance in needle-in-a-haystack tests rather than its ability to reason about the entire context (refer to this [Google blog post](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-next-generation-model-february-2024/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment also connects to ongoing work with [LLM routers](https://github.com/pulzeai-oss/knn-router). If a prompt is particularly complex, it could be routed to a more advanced model or an 'agent' that divides the task and performs quality assurance before delivering the final result."

The film had not only shattered **inflation** fears but had also become a cultural phenomenon. Sitting under the shade of a giant **oak** **tree** on his sprawling estate, he basked in the golden glow of the late afternoon sun.

A melody from a passing car, a **violin** playing a melancholic piece of **classical music**, underscored their solemn mood.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The playwright, an avid listener of **NPR**, mentioned a fascinating upcoming **exhibition** at the Museum of Modern Art, showcasing the works of Sylvia Plath, his favorite **poet**.

The producer, heart full, realized that this feeling, this sense of accomplishment, was what made all the hard work worthwhile. The roar of the crowd faded as he lost himself in the music, a local band playing a **concert** nearby, their music a celebration of life, art, and the simple joy of a well-told story. As the last notes of the music faded, the two men shook hands, their conversation leaving a lasting impression like a perfectly played game of **chess** on a rainy **spring** evening.  He looked up at the star-studded sky, his gaze lingering on **Mars**, a symbol of human ambition and the endless possibilities that lay ahead. \n",

      "Later that week, I found myself seeking solace in the cool darkness of a movie **theater**, the smell of popcorn filling the air. \"The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\" was playing, a **popular movie** that transported me to a fantastical world of elves and orcs, **kings** and **queens**, and epic battles between good and evil – a far cry from the mundane reality of debugging my latest **Python** code for my computer science degree. \n",

      "The memory sparked another thought. I remembered reading Tolkien's epic fantasy series during a rainy **spring** break in **London**. I had spent hours wandering the hallowed halls of the British Museum, marveling at the Rosetta Stone and other ancient artifacts. One afternoon, I had taken refuge from a sudden downpour in a small café near **Hyde Park**, the lush green **trees** providing a welcome respite from the bustling **city**.

It was a reminder of the power of art, in all its forms, to capture the human experience, to move us, to challenge us, and to ultimately connect us to something greater than ourselves. I thought of the **screenwriter** who brought those fictional stories to life, the **producer** who took a chance on a young director, the musicians who poured their souls into their music, the artists who dared to bare their souls on canvas. And in that moment, I felt a surge of gratitude for the creators, the dreamers, the storytellers who enrich our lives with beauty, meaning, and a profound sense of shared humanity. \n",

      "response text A renowned screenwriter, known for his love of the French New Wave movement and his collection of vintage \"Rolling Stone\" magazines, found himself wandering through the Louvre on a sweltering Tuesday in August.  He'd just finished a grueling meeting with the prince of a minor European country who was bankrolling his latest project - a biopic about a jazz trumpeter's rise to fame during the Great Depression.  The film was to be shot on location in the Sahara Desert and star, much to the screenwriter's chagrin, a certain reality TV star famous for their catchphrase on the hit show \"Island Time\".  \n",
      "\n",
      "As he stood before the \"Mona Lisa\", his phone buzzed.  It was his agent.  The studio, a behemoth in the industry, was demanding script changes. They wanted more action, more romance, more CGI tornadoes ripping through the Milky Way galaxy.  Furthermore, they wanted the film scored using only the Python programming language and the Treaty of Versailles as inspiration for the soundtrack.\n",
      "\n",
      "The screenwriter sighed.  He understood the economics of the film industry - supply and demand, profit margins, risk aversion - but couldn't they see the artistic integrity of his vision?  He longed for the simpler days, back when he was just a struggling playwright in Greenwich Village, seeking inspiration from the photographs of Diane Arbus and the changing seasons on the banks of the Hudson River. \n",
      "\n",
      "He knew he had a decision to make.  He could stand his ground, risking the wrath of the studio and the prince's investment.  Or he could compromise his vision for the sake of getting the film made.  His heart ached with a familiar frustration, a feeling as vast and unforgiving as the K2 mountain range.  He just wanted to tell a good story.  But in an industry driven by algorithms and box office numbers, was that even possible anymore? \n",

      "response text The excitement was palpable backstage. The renowned theater producer paced nervously, his face ashen grey under the stage lights. His new play, a whimsical allegory about the Treaty of Versailles using the metaphor of a wilting sunflower, was set to open on Broadway that night.  The playwright, a rising star known for his use of irony, had poured his heart and soul into the production. \n",
      "\n",
      "Outside, the remnants of a recent hurricane lashed the city with relentless rain. Despite the weather, the buzz about the play had reached fever pitch on social media platforms like Twitter. Tickets were scarcer than diamonds, with scalpers demanding exorbitant prices. Even Zeus himself couldn't have secured a seat at this point.\n",
      "\n",
      "Backstage, the lead actress, a dead ringer for Daenerys Targaryen from Game of Thrones, tuned her violin, a nervous habit she'd developed during her time at the Royal Ballet School. The news of the play had even eclipsed the Yankees' World Series victory on local radio station WNYC, a testament to its anticipated success. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the first notes of a melancholic jazz piece filled the theater, signaling the start of the performance, the producer took a deep breath.  This play, he hoped, would be his magnum opus, his Everest. He envisioned a cascade of positive reviews, a sold-out run throughout the spring season, and maybe even a Tony Award to top it all off. But for now, all he could do was wait and hope that the magic he'd witnessed in rehearsals would translate onto the stage and into the hearts of the audience. This wasn't just a play; it was an exploration of human emotion, a commentary on economic disparity symbolized by the divide between the opulent theater and the struggling artists who brought it to life. \n",

      "In the grand scheme of the universe, smaller than a speck of dust on Jupiter, this night might seem insignificant.  Yet, within the walls of that theater, under the watchful gaze of the sculpted mahogany tree that adorned the balcony, it held the weight of dreams, aspirations, and the timeless power of storytelling. The curtain rose, and the world outside, from the Coachella festival to the latest art exhibition at the MoMA, seemed to fade away, leaving only the stage, the actors, and the hushed anticipation of the audience. \n",

A director was yelling, \"Cut!\" and **Leonardo DiCaprio** walked past, giving me a knowing nod. I felt like I was in the middle of filming for the **Academy Awards**.\n",

      "Suddenly, the scene dissolved, and I was standing on a vast beach, the **Pacific Ocean** stretching out before me. A copy of **The Times** newspaper lay at my feet, and a story about **Princess Diana** caught my eye.  The article mentioned a poetry reading by **Maya Angelou** that Diana had attended.

His photos, slated for publication by a prestigious New York publishing house, aimed to capture not just the dance, but the emotion of \"duende\" - a Spanish term for artistic inspiration often associated with flamenco. The photographer, a devout Buddhist, believed his lens could bridge cultural and religious divides. He uploaded his work to Instagram, sparking debate about intellectual property law and fair use in the digital age. \n",

      "His travels took him to a small village nestled near the Amazon rainforest, ravaged by a recent hurricane. The economic impact of the natural disaster was palpable - tourism, once the lifeblood of the community, had dried up.  He met a young musician there, a skilled flutist, who told him stories of the river’s wrath, weaving folklore and historical accounts into lyrical narratives reminiscent of epic poetry. This encounter sparked an idea. What if, the photographer thought, he could organize a benefit concert, featuring the young flutist alongside a local tango orchestra?  \n",

      "He reached out to his friend, a rising film director known for her work in the thriller genre, who jumped at the opportunity to film the event. The concert, scheduled for Easter Sunday, would be held on a stage erected where a southerly wind blew across the village square. The goal was to raise funds to rebuild the village museum, which housed local artifacts and a stunning collection of orchids.  A website was set up to sell tickets, with all proceeds going to the village. The event even caught the attention of Leonardo DiCaprio, an outspoken advocate for environmental causes, who promoted it on his social media. \n",

      "On the day of the concert, the village pulsed with anticipation. A local troupe performed a traditional celebratory dance, their colorful costumes adorned with sunflowers, adding to the festive atmosphere.  The concert was a resounding success. The music, captured on film and shared widely online, became a symbol of hope and resilience.  Even the photographer, known for his stoicism, couldn't help but be moved by the experience. The playwright Arthur Miller once said, \"The theater is so endlessly fascinating because it's so accidental.  It's so much like life.\"  Looking out at the smiling faces in the crowd, the photographer realized this rang true not just for theater, but for the universal language of art itself, a language capable of transcending borders, bridging cultures, and inspiring hope even in the face of adversity. He knew this experience, captured in his photos and his friend's film, would stay with him long after he returned home from this remarkable journey. \n",

Her favorite poem, a poignant exploration of isolation and resilience, resonated deeply with her own experiences.  Her story, I knew, needed to be told. And just like that, amidst the chaos and uncertainty of the real world, I found solace in the world I was creating, a world where even the most disparate elements could coexist, where the haunting melody of a flute could mingle with the roar of the ocean, where a single rose could bloom in the heart of the desert. The story poured out of me, a testament to the enduring power of art, a defiant act of creation in the face of destruction. The news played on, the wind howled outside, but I was lost in the world of my creation, accompanied only by the rhythmic click-clack of the keyboard and the occasional witty comment from **Sheldon Cooper**, my favorite **character from a TV show**, echoing in my head.  The blank page was no longer daunting but an invitation, a blank canvas on which I could paint my own version of reality, inspired by the world around me, yet entirely my own.  The story was far from over, the **art nouveau** movement inspiring the visuals I was starting to imagine, but I knew, with a certainty that settled deep in my bones, that it was a story worth telling. \n",

He had been struggling with writer’s block, but Eleanor's story, with its echoes of ancient myths and the enduring spirit of nature, sparked an idea.

The wolf in his story, he decided, would be named Luna, a silent tribute to the captivating image that had finally broken his writer’s block and set him free. \n",

His parched throat felt like it hadn't seen water since the biblical flood.  He ducked into a rundown theater, its facade cracked and faded like a forgotten Hollywood starlet.  Inside, the musty air hung heavy with the ghosts of past performances.  A lone radio station played a mournful blues riff, a stark contrast to the pulsating joy of the \"Fortnite\" tournament advertised on a flickering TV screen that showed Channel 5 news.  \n",

      "The news played on, oblivious to his internal turmoil:  a hurricane brewing in the Atlantic, a record-breaking heatwave in Europe, the ongoing conflict in a distant galaxy far, far away...  He barely registered the information. He was lost in his own world, a world built on the unreliable narrative technique of stream of consciousness, a world where the past, present, and future blurred together like watercolors on a canvas. He thought of King Arthur, his favorite subject in childhood, and the legend of Excalibur. A poster for \"The Avengers\" on the theater wall, slightly obscured by a wilting fern, reminded him of Thor, the God of Thunder, and the power of myth.  He longed for a simpler time, a time before the war, before his heart had become a desolate wasteland of broken dreams and unfulfilled promises.\n",

He stared at the blinking cursor, paralyzed by a familiar wave of self-doubt.  He needed inspiration, a divine intervention, a bolt of lightning to jolt him out of his creative slump.  He glanced at a nearby poster for a photography exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art featuring the works of Ansel Adams, the way the artist captured light and shadow with his trusty Canon. He felt a flicker of hope, a small ember of determination igniting in his chest.  \n",

He wrote about loss and redemption, about the complex geometry of human relationships, about the enduring power of faith.  He wrote until the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in a fiery palette of orange, red, and purple.  He wrote until the first stars began to appear, tiny pinpricks of light in the vast expanse of the Milky Way.  He wrote until he found a sliver of peace, a moment of grace in the midst of the storm. He wouldn't win any Nobel Prizes for Literature, but it was a start.  He closed his laptop, his heart lighter than it had been in months. Maybe, just maybe, he wasn't finished yet. \n",
